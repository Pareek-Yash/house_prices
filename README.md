# House Prices

Predict the final prices of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, based on a dataset with 79 explanatory variables.

## Getting Started

To set up your local development environment, please run:

    poetry install

Behind the scenes, this creates a virtual environment and installs `house_prices` along with its dependencies into a new virtualenv.
Whenever you run `poetry run <command>`, that `<command>` is actually run inside the virtualenv managed by poetry.

You can now import functions and classes from the module with `import house_prices`.

If you want to deploy this project as a docker container, please ensure that [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) are installed, then run

    docker-compose up

this will build the entire project with all dependencies inside a docker container. You may use the command line interface of the application now, e.g. by editing the `command` tag in the [`docker-compose.yml`](./docker-compose.yml).

### Testing

We use `pytest` as test framework. To execute the tests, please run

    pytest tests

To run the tests with coverage information, please use

    pytest tests --cov=src --cov-report=html --cov-report=term

and have a look at the `htmlcov` folder, after the tests are done.

### Distribution Package

To build a distribution package (wheel), please use

    poetry build

You can find the build artifacts in the `dist` folder.

### Contributions

Before contributing, please set up the pre-commit hooks to reduce errors and ensure consistency

    pip install -U pre-commit
    pre-commit install

If you run into any issues, you can remove the hooks again with `pre-commit uninstall`.
